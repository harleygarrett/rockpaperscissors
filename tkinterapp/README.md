## Project Brief

### Overview

In this project, the user’s playmate would be the computer or the program that you’ve designed. User takes the first turn and picks one option while in the next turn, your program randomly picks one out three options. Each game would have 5 rounds (5 chances to each player). Your program has to keep a track of the scores and display the winner at the end of the game. Your program should also allow the user to replay or quit.

### Goals

1. Function that randomly picks an option incase of computer’s turn.
2. Function to validate the user’s input and keep a track of scores.
3. Display the winner.
4. Allow for replay.
